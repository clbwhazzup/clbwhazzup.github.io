                        This is a spool holder I designed specifically so I wouldn't have to 
                        buy an Automatic Material System for my Bambu Lab printer. The spool holder can 
                        hold up to 1KG spools for 1.75mm filament. The spool holders are designed with hooks 
                        so that they can connect to each other in multiple ways. Technically, this could be used 
                        for many things. The model was made in Autodesk Fusion, but I have not printed 
                        it due to the high cost and the lack of actual need. I will upload it to MakerWorld 
                        once I confirm that it prints correctly and is strong enough for 1KG spools.

                        This was pretty complex for one of my first projects in Autodesk Fusion. I've 
                        seen those cheap emulation machines online for a while, and once I got a 
                        3D printer, I had to make my own out of an old phone and controller 
                        I have. I decided to design these 3D models in Fusion around these parts 
                        and I've gotten great results so far. The controller circuit board is from a cheap, 
                        generic controller, and the phone is a Galaxy S5 with custom firmware. The 
                        project is still not complete, since I found the the hinge to be the hardest 
                        part. The files will be uploaded to MakerWorld once it's done just for easy viewing.

                        This is a portable container I designed to be used for anything. It's 
                        an extremely simple model that I made in Autodesk Fusion. There are 2 parts that 
                        are printed and connected with just a piece of 1.75mm 3D printing filament. 
                        The container holds itself closed due to a low tolerance in between 
                        the 2 printed parts. I may adapt this for a print-in-place design. The source file 
                        will not be available, but the model is available for download

                        This is a phone model and animation I made for a 
                        college course. It was made at the beginning of my college 
                        career in 3DS Max. It was then refined and polished for 
                        the capstone course of my degree. During the capstone, 
                        I also decided it was necessary to be able to import it 
                        into a game engine. I found that it was very simple to export 
                        and import the project into Unreal Engine. I also used 
                        ffmpeg to convert the image sequence to a video. I then used 
                        it to convert the video to a GIF for this website. The source files 
                        are available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/PhoneModelAnimation">here</a>, and 
                        all files can be downloaded under Releases on the right.

                        <strong id="strong">Reflection</strong>
                        <br>I learned
                        how to model with reference images. I was able to take
                        2D shapes and create a 3D model. I also learned how to 
                        use 3DS Max more efficiently. There are, like other
                        professional software, many shortcuts to save time. 
                        I also learned how to import assets into Unreal. I 
                        discovered that many softwares can export to .fbx files,
                        and Unreal can import those files. There's also lots of
                        settings to make sure you only import what you need. 
                        
                        <br><br>The 
                        main challenge I faced was cleaning up the model. I 
                        needed to get rid of a lot of unnecessary vertices, but 
                        I couldn't find an easy way to do that. I decided to
                        manually remove the vertices, and add back some edges to
                        make the faces transition more smoothly. Finally, I learned
                        how to use ffmpeg to convert between image and video file 
                        types. I went from an image sequence to a video, and then
                        from a video to a GIF to avoid embedding the video. 
                        
                        <br><br>The model's main improvement was its animation. It's 
                        now much more detailed, and includes movement on the phone 
                        buttons. Any button can move, but I have it type 911. The 
                        models were also slightly improved. Like I said, I removed
                        a ton of vertices, and the handset now has speaker and
                        microphone holes. I also changed the smoothing on the model.
