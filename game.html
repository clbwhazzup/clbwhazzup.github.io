                        This is a prototype game which has a working title of 
                        GrowOpSim. I would like to further develop this game, 
                        but I have not looked for a team or found the time 
                        to develop it. I wrote this entirely in Unreal
                        Blueprints. The source files can be found 
                        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/GrowOpSim">
                        here</a>, along with the zipped game under "Releases" on the right.
                        The main gameplay is growing and selling plants, while 
                        upgrading your stuff, like pots and seeds. When I started
                        this project, there wasn't many realistic growing games,
                        so I felt the need to fill that space. This still does
                        get occcasional updates, but releases are much rarer.

                        This is a phone model and animation I made for a 
                        college course. It was made at the beginning of my college 
                        career in 3DS Max. It was then refined and polished for 
                        the capstone course of my degree. During the capstone, 
                        I also decided it was necessary to be able to import it 
                        into a game engine. I found that it was very simple to export 
                        and import the project into Unreal Engine. I also used 
                        ffmpeg to convert the image sequence to a video. I then used 
                        it to convert the video to a GIF for this website. The source files 
                        are available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/PhoneModelAnimation">here</a>, and 
                        all files can be downloaded under Releases on the right.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong id="strong">Reflection</strong>
                        <br>I learned
                        how to model with reference images. I was able to take
                        2D shapes and create a 3D model. I also learned how to 
                        use 3DS Max more efficiently. There are, like other
                        professional software, many shortcuts to save time. 
                        I also learned how to import assets into Unreal. I 
                        discovered that many softwares can export to .fbx files,
                        and Unreal can import those files. There's also lots of
                        settings to make sure you only import what you need. 
                        
                        <br><br>The 
                        main challenge I faced was cleaning up the model. I 
                        needed to get rid of a lot of unnecessary vertices, but 
                        I couldn't find an easy way to do that. I decided to
                        manually remove the vertices, and add back some edges to
                        make the faces transition more smoothly. Finally, I learned
                        how to use ffmpeg to convert between image and video file 
                        types. I went from an image sequence to a video, and then
                        from a video to a GIF to avoid embedding the video. 
                        
                        <br><br>The model's main improvement was its animation. It's 
                        now much more detailed, and includes movement on the phone 
                        buttons. Any button can move, but I have it type 911. The 
                        models were also slightly improved. Like I said, I removed
                        a ton of vertices, and the handset now has speaker and
                        microphone holes. I also changed the smoothing on the model.

                        This is a game prototype called Metallic Detective:
                        Treasure Hunter. It was made at the beginning of my college
                        career, and was then refined and polished for the capstone
                        course of my degree. It was originally made in Unreal 4, and 
                        then upgraded to Unreal 5. In the game, players dig up and collect
                        treasures within a time limit. There's a metal detector that 
                        has visual and audio output. The source files are available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/Binda_Treasure_Polished">here</a>, and 
                        playable files are under Releases on the right.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong id="strong">Reflection</strong>
                        <br>Without following an exact guide, 
                        there was a lot learning in Unreal. I had to learn a lot about
                        Blueprints in the class, and reuse or modify those concepts for 
                        the requirements of the game. During the capstone, I learned
                        a little about upgrading from Unreal 4 to 5. For a blueprint 
                        project, there is some code that needs to be changed. This was a 
                        challenge I faced, but all I needed was to do was delete some VR 
                        code. 
                        
                        <br><br>The main challenge was trying to fix my destructible 
                        objects. Unreal 4 used Apex for destructible objects, while 
                        Unreal 5 uses Chaos. I had to learn how to use the new geometry 
                        collection system, which basically required me to replace the 
                        static mesh with a geometry collection in runtime. I also had to
                        learn how to create geometry collections from existing meshes, 
                        which is done in fracture mode. 

                        <br><br>The game's main improvement was the metal detector. It now has visual
                        and audio feedback instead of light over the diggable spots. There's 
                        a bar that goes down and the beeps get faster as the player gets 
                        closer. The level also looks a lot nicer, as I used the foliage
                        mode with custom meshes to randomly place trees and grass. There is also 
                        now a start screen, and pause screen on top of the end screen, with 
                        options to restart, quit, or continue, depending on which one.

                        <br>
                        This is a game survival game prototype. It was made later in my college 
                        career, and then refined and polished for the capstone of my degree. It
                        was made entirely in Unreal 5, with a mix of C++ and Blueprint classes.
                        There are objectives for collecting resources and building. There are 
                        also basic enemies that wander, and chase and attack the player when 
                        seen or touched. The player can also hit them to kill them. The source files 
                        are available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/BindaGAM312">here</a>, and 
                        playable files are under Releases on the right.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong id="strong">Reflection</strong>
                        <br>One thing I learned was how to create objectives 
                        for the player. This was something I wasn't sure how to tackle,
                        but now I have a better idea. I also learned more about modeling 
                        and texturing in Unreal. Using the modelling mode, I created trees,
                        rocks, and bushes, which served as the resources for the game. I 
                        also learned a simple way to apply different materials to different 
                        parts of objects. Finally, I learned how to create a navigation mesh, 
                        and how to use that for the AI. During the capstone, I learned how to use 
                        behavior trees and how to program for that. In a personal project,
                        I also wanted AI, so I taught myself there before taking on this 
                        feature. I also learned how to use actors in the foliage mode. Unreal 
                        has a way to convert actors to foliage actors, so that their code 
                        still runs. This also allowed to use foliage mode to randomly place 
                        resources with a sort of painting tool. One final thing I learned was 
                        how to use the default animations on custom characters. It just requires 
                        either a small code or setting change. 
                        
                        <br><br>The main challenge I faced 
                        was upgrading the project to Unreal 5.5 from 5.2. Since there's 
                        a built-in upgrade tool, I thought I would be fine. However, I found 
                        that there were a lot of errors coming up in the conversion process, 
                        and there was an option to open Visual Studio. It gave me a hint that 
                        the .cs files had wrong include versions, and I found the problem. I 
                        thought I fixed it, but when I tried to upgrade again, I got the same 
                        errors. I eventually realized that it was making a new copy every time 
                        I upgraded the project, so I had to change the files, and just open
                        from the new folder that I was actually changing. Another challenge I 
                        had was with the AI. They would chase the player, but stop every time
                        they reached the destination they decided the player was at. I realized
                        this was because I had them navigating to the player's location, not
                        the player actor. I changed the service that found the player to just 
                        return the player actor object instead of a vector, and now they follow 
                        without stopping. Finally, another challenge that I decided to work 
                        around was C++ decorators, services, and tasks. I couldn't, at the time,
                        figure how I would cast to blueprint classes (the AI) from C++ code. I 
                        later learned I could probably use Blueprint Implementable Events.

                        <br><br>Most of the improvements were related to the AI enemies. They originally 
                        wandered, but on top of that, they now have animations, and can 
                        sense the player, chase them, and attack them when in range. The player
                        can also attack the enemies. I also expanded the map, changed the 
                        resource availability, and added better materials to the structures. 
                        By using the foliage mode to place actors, I may have also improved 
                        performance a little, although it wasn't really a problem. It was also
                        given a start screen, pause screen, and end screen, like the other artifacts.

                        <br>
                        This is a parkour game prototype. It was made later in my college
                        career, and then refined and polished for the capstone of my degree.
                        It was made entirely in Unreal 5, with a mix of C++ and Blueprint classes.
                        The player can move jump, and place platforms off of other ones with a 
                        gun. There are also portals that "catch" the player and teleport them back.
                        These portals also allow you to see the level from above. Finally, there 
                        are jump boosts to jump higher, and bounce pads that launch the player. 
                        The source files are available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/BindaGAM415">here</a>, and 
                        playable files are under Releases on the right.

                        <strong id="strong">Reflection</strong>
                        <br>While creating the project,
                        I learned a lot about graphics. I learned about dynamic materials, which 
                        can change in runtime. I also learned about particle effects, which add a 
                        lot of life to the game. They were used for the gun. Another thing I learned 
                        was how to make procedural meshes. This was used a terrain and could be modified 
                        by the gun. During the capstone, one thing I learned was how laggy scene captures 
                        (cameras) can be. Having 20 if them in the level just freezes the editor, but I 
                        also learned how to mitigate it. I just used the portal's variable for the player 
                        camera location, and had it disable its scene capture when the player was far 
                        enough away. This had the added benefit of acutally changing the scene capture 
                        when the player moved. I also have learned more about git through losing and 
                        recovering my files. I specifically learned how to go "back in time" in git, 
                        and modify a commit, with the reset and ammend commands. 
                        
                        <br><br>I kind of already talked about challenges, but the main one was 
                        the lag from the scene captures. My attempt during refinement didn't work 
                        correctly, so I removed it and tried again during polish. I was only able to get 
                        it to work because I realized the portals already somehow had the player's location, 
                        and I just had to find it. The other main challenge was losing my files, which 
                        has not been overcome yet. I accidentally left the packaged project in the files, 
                        which was too big to be uploaded. In trying to remove those files, I lost a 
                        bunch, although they were still recoverable. I eventually learned about the 
                        ammend command, which changes a commit based on the current working tree. I reset 
                        to after my polish commit, used reset to untrack the PackagedBuilds folder, and then 
                        used commit --ammend to change the commit. My next challenge was getting 
                        the platforms to spawn when the gun's projectile hits something. I realized 
                        from past experience that I can make a UPROPERTY that could be set in the Blueprint 
                        for that C++ class, avoiding the need to create another C++ class. I discovered 
                        that the spawned platforms would have to be actors, and not just meshes, though. 
                        
                        <br><br>The game was improved by 
                        making an entire game concept out of the features I already created. I realized 
                        that the portals would be an interesting way to checkpoint the player through a 
                        basic parkour level, since a player could see the level from above, but a little 
                        behind. I also thought that the parkour should have some other features, so I 
                        decided to include jump boosts, bounce pads, and the platform gun. It was also
                        given a start screen, pause screen, and end screen, like the other artifacts.
