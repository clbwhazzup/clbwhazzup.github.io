                        This is a prototype game which has a working title of 
                        GrowOpSim. I would like to further develop this game, 
                        but I have not looked for a team or found the time 
                        to develop it. I wrote this entirely in Unreal
                        Blueprints. The source files can be found 
                        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/clbwhazzup/GrowOpSim">
                        here</a>, along with the zipped game under "Releases" on the right.
                        The main gameplay is growing and selling plants, while 
                        upgrading your stuff, like pots and seeds. When I started
                        this project, there wasn't many realistic growing games,
                        so I felt the need to fill that space. This still does
                        get occcasional updates, but releases are much rarer.

                        This is a phone model and animation I made for a 
                        college course. It was made at the beginning of my college 
                        career in 3DS Max. It was then refined and polished for 
                        the capstone course of my degree. During the capstone, 
                        I also decided it was necessary to be able to import it 
                        into a game engine. I found that it was very simple to export 
                        and import the project into Unreal Engine. There is currently 
                        not a source file for this project.
