                        This is a JavaScript extension for browsers that
                        mutes fullscreen video ads on twitch.tv. Twitch's ads 
                        are known to be hard to block. People have done it, 
                        but I couldn't find a working extension. I thought 
                        it would be interesting to try it myself. I was able
                        to do it, but it plays the video at full volume, and then 
                        breaks the video player at the end. I settled on just 
                        muting them, and have never revisted the project. The 
                        source code can be found

                        Besides Python, this also uses MongoDB to connect to an existing
                        database. It also includes a Jupyter Notebook file I wrote to run 
                        a website that allows users to search without programming knowledge. 
                        In that file, I gained some experience with the Dash framework 
                        for web development. It was intended for an animal shelter to allow 
                        employees to find dogs that fit requirements for different search and
                        rescue applications. It gives categories of these different dogs 
                        that can be clicked to filter the database. The source code can be found

                        I programmed the website with HTML and CSS using a basic HTML 
                        template. The source code can be found

                        I decided to code this directly because not only is it 
                        cleaner, but I have more control over the details.

                        websites, so it included a menu, a contact page, and an about
