                        This is a phone model and animation I made for a 
                        college course. It was made at the beginning of my college 
                        career in 3DS Max. It was then refined and polished for 
                        the capstone course of my degree. During the capstone, 
                        I also decided it was necessary to be able to import it 
                        into a game engine. I found that it was very simple to export 
                        and import the project into Unreal Engine. I also used 
                        ffmpeg to convert the image sequence to a video. I then used 
                        it to convert the video to a GIF for this website.

                        I would describe creating and polishing the artifact as 
                        insightful. The reason I say that is because I got over
                        the hurdle of 3D modeling and Unreal imports, and 
                        realized it wasn't as difficult as I thought. I learned
                        how to model with reference images. I was able to take
                        2D shapes and create a 3D model. I also learned how to 
                        use 3DS Max more efficiently. There are, like other
                        professional software, many shortcuts to save time. 
                        I also learned how to import assets into Unreal. I 
                        discovered that many softwares can export to .fbx files,
                        and Unreal can import those files. There's also lots of
                        settings to make sure you only import what you need. The 
                        main challenge I faced was cleaning up the model. I 
                        needed to get rid of a lot of unnecessary vertices, but 
                        I couldn't find an easy way to do that. I decided to
                        manually remove the vertices, and add back some edges to
                        make the faces transition more smoothly. Finally, I learned
                        how to use ffmpeg to convert between image and video file 
                        types. I went from an image sequence to a video, and then
                        from a video to a GIF to avoid embedding the video. I incorporated
                        feedback by considering time. I had to efficiently split my
                        time between four projects. I barely remembered 3DS Max,
                        so I had to consider how long it would to relearn how to
                        do what I wanted, and then how long the change would take
                        itself. The model's main improvement was its animation. It's 
                        now much more detailed, and includes movement on the phone 
                        buttons. Any button can move, but I have it type 911. The 
                        models were also slightly improved. Like I said, I removed
                        a ton of vertices, and the handset now has speaker and
                        microphone holes. I also changed the smoothing on the model.

                        This is a game prototype called Metallic Detective:
                        Treasure Hunter. It was made at the beginning of my college
                        career, and was then refined and polished for the capstone
                        course of my degree. It was originally made in Unreal 4, and 
                        then upgraded to Unreal 5. In the game, players dig up and collect
                        treasures within a time limit. There is a metal detector that 
                        has visual and audio output.

                        I would describe creating and polishing the artifact as 
                        fun. I think this was the first time I made an actual game
                        in Unreal, and it was nice to polish it as a single experience. 
                        It was so great to be able to play something that I made 
                        without direct tutorials. Without following an exact guide, 
                        there was a lot learning in Unreal. I had to learn a lot about
                        Blueprints in the class, and reuse or modify those concepts for 
                        the requirements of the game. During the capstone, I learned
                        a little about upgrading from Unreal 4 to 5. For a blueprint 
                        project, there is some code that needs to be changed. This was a 
                        challenge I faced, but all I needed was to do was delete some VR 
                        code. The main challenge was trying to fix my destructible 
                        objects. Unreal 4 used Apex for destructible objects, while 
                        Unreal 5 uses Chaos. I had to learn how to use the new geometry 
                        collection system, which basically required me to replace the 
                        static mesh with a geometry collection in runtime.
